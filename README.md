https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/#react-and-redux

This project uses React and Markdown parser library to parse html syntax.
- It consists of an editor which is predefined with some text & preview.
- The markdown library will parse the text in the editor, and show the results in the preview in real time.

There is an input state which follows user input, and updates the preview accordingly.
